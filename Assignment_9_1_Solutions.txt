1) What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer?

petrol_data = LOAD 'petrol_dataset.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (DistId:chararray, DistName:chararray, BuyRate:chararray, SellRate:chararray, VolIn:int, VolOut:int, Year:int);

group_by_dist = GROUP petrol_data BY DistName;

total_volume_sold_per_Distributor = foreach group_by_dist generate group, SUM(petrol_data.VolOut);

dump total_volume_sold_per_Distributor;

2) Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of petrol sold in volume.

petrol_data = LOAD 'petrol_dataset.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (DistId:chararray, DistName:chararray, BuyRate:chararray, SellRate:chararray, VolIn:int, VolOut:int, Year:int);

group_by_distid = GROUP petrol_data BY DistId;

sum_sold_by_distid = FOREACH group_by_distid GENERATE group, SUM(petrol_data.VolOut) as sold;

sort_volout = ORDER sum_sold_by_distid BY sold DESC;

top_10_sold = LIMIT sort_volout 10;

dump top_10_sold;

3) List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

petrol_data = LOAD 'petrol_dataset.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (DistId:chararray, DistName:chararray, BuyRate:chararray, SellRate:chararray, VolIn:int, VolOut:int, Year:int);

group_by_distid = GROUP petrol_data BY DistId;

total_volume_sold_per_Distributor = foreach group_by_distid generate group, petrol_data.DistName, petrol_data.Year, SUM(petrol_data.VolOut) as sold;

sort_volout = ORDER total_volume_sold_per_Distributor BY sold DESC;

data = FOREACH sort_volout GENERATE group,FLATTEN($1), FLATTEN($2), sold;

top_10 = LIMIT data 10;

dump top_10;

4) Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.

petrol_data = LOAD 'petrol_dataset.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (DistId:chararray, DistName:chararray, BuyRate:chararray, SellRate:chararray, VolIn:int, VolOut:int, Year:int);

group_by_dist = GROUP petrol_data BY DistName;

total_volume_sold_per_Distributor = foreach group_by_dist generate group, SUM(petrol_data.VolOut) as sold;

sort_volout = ORDER total_volume_sold_per_Distributor BY sold ASC;

least_sold = LIMIT sort_volout 1;

dump least_sold;
